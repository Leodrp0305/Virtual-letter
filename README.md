# Virtual-letter

> A personal project designed to work as a online letter. Even tho letters may feel rustic way of sending a message, it's undeniable that it has some charm in it, so in order to give it a modern twist I've made this project. It's important to keep in mind that as i wrote this code expecting someone that reads portuguese to read it, every aspect of the code that is possible written in Portuguese has been written in Portuguese.

## How to use?

There are two ways I've used to send this application to someone:

<ul>
  <li>Hosting a website using any plataform in my case it was <a href="https://pages.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> </li>
  <li>Sending the compacted files in zip for example to the person meant to recive the letter</li>
</ul>

Hosting a website is easier to the one receiving and recommended if the person have no knowledge in the area, thought it's is easier a important thing to keep in mind is that the website is public to anyone which finds the url. (Can be embarrassing😳)

Sending the compacted files is private which some letters should be to avoid important data to be exploited, or whatever, also if it's compacted as a zip, rar or tar.gz makes it simpler to save for as much time as you and the other person want
