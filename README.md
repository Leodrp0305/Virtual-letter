# Virtual-letter

> A personal project designed to work as an online letter. Even thought letters may feel rustic way of sending a message, it's undeniable that it has some charm in it, so in order to give it a modern twist I've made this project. It's important to keep in mind that as i wrote this code expecting someone that reads portuguese to read it, every aspect of the code that is possible written in Portuguese has been written in Portuguese.

## How to use?

There are two ways I've used to send this application to someone:

<ul>
  <li>Hosting a website using any platform in my case it was <a href="https://pages.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> </li><br>
  
  This option is easier for the recipient and is recommended if the person has no technical knowledge.  
   However, keep in mind that the website will be **public**, which means anyone who finds the URL can see it.  
   (That might be a little embarrassing 😳)
   
  <li>Sending the compacted files in zip for example to the person meant to recive the letter</li><br>
  
  **Sending the compacted files (e.g., .zip, .rar, .tar.gz)** directly to the intended recipient  
   This method is **more private**, which is ideal if the letter contains sensitive or personal content.  
   Plus, a compressed file is easy to store and keep for as long as you and the other person want.

</ul>
