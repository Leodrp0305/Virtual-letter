# Virtual-letter

> A personal project designed to work as a online letter. Even tho letters may feel rustic way of sending a message, it's undeniable that it has some charm in it, so in order to give it a modern twist I've made this project. It's important to keep in mind that as i wrote this code expecting someone that reads portuguese to read it, every aspect of the code that is possible written in Portuguese has been written in Portuguese.

## How to use?

There are two ways I've used to send this application to someone:

<ul>
  <li>Hosting a website using any plataform in my case it was <a href="https://pages.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>) </li>
  <li>Sending the compacted files in zip for example to the person meant to recive the letter</li>
</ul>
