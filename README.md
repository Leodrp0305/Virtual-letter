# Virtual-letter
A personal project designed to work as a online letter. Even tho letters may feel rustic way of sending a message, it's undeniable that it has some charm in it, so in order to give it a modern twist I've made this project. It's important to keep in mind that as i wrote this code expecting someone that reads portuguese to read it, every aspect of the code that is possible written in Portuguese has been written in Portuguese.

<h1>How to use?</h1>

< There are two ways I've used to send this application to someone:

<ul>
  <li>upload the application to send as a website, for example using github pages(the one i used) (less secure and completely public)</li>
  <li>Sending the files in a zip to the person meant to recive (more secure and private)</li>
</ul>
